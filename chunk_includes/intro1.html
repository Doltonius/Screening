<b>Instructions</b>
</p>
<p>
  Welcome! In this experiment, you'll be presented with some sentences and your task is to rate <b>how acceptable they are as English sentences</b>. You can just make your judgments based on your native-speaker intuition; in other words, how acceptable a sentence sounds to you.
</p>
The experiment is not long, but during this time please give your <b>full attention</b> to it.
<p>
Note that we'll have certain "checkpoint sentences" to ensure that you're indeed paying attention to the task. If your responses indicate that you did not fully attend to this experiment, we reserve the right to withhold payment.
